# 2. Release versioning

Date: 2021-06-16

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Releases will need identified to allow the tracking of bugs and new features against deployed code.

## Decision

We will use [Semantic Versioning][semver] and [git tagging][gittag] for each release.

## Consequences

Tracking any problems or bug to a version of the code should be simpler. Version number will need to be updated
