# 3. Keeping changelogs

Date: 2021-06-16

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need to see precisely what notable changes have been made between each release (or version) of the project.

## Decision

We will [keep a changelog][keep-a-changelog] of those notable changes for each repo.

## Consequences

We will need to keep the changelog updated and make sure each new repo has one in the first place.
