# 1. Record architecture decisions

Date: 2021-06-16

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We [need to record][write-things-down] the [decisions][why-adrs] made on this project

## Decision

We will use [Architecture Decision Records][adr] (ADR), as [described by Michael Nygard][Michael-Nygard]. They will be managed by Nat Pryce's [adr-tools][adr-tools]. The process aim to [support maintainers and future engineers][maintainers] while [remaining lightweight][lightweight].

## Consequences 

From [Michael Nygard][Michael-Nygard]'s article:
> One ADR describes one significant decision for a specific project. It should be something that has an effect on how the rest of the project will run.
> 
> The consequences of one ADR are very likely to become the context for subsequent ADRs.
